TESTING USING JASMINE

This is a basic feed reader application (provided by Udacity) that requires a student to conduct several tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). 

## How to run the project

Open index.html in the browser of your choice. As soon as document is loaded a series of tests starts. The results will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
If successful all results will be dipslayed green.
